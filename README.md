# @appnest/lit-util

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

This project is a collection of functions I tend to use when building projects based on lit-html. The goal is to give you some inspiration and make your life a little easier when finding yourself in need of the same functionality.


## ðŸŽ‰ Install the dependency

```javascript
npm i @appnest/lit-util
```

## ðŸ¦€ Use `@customElement()` to define your custom elements.

Use the `customElement` decorator to define your custom elements. Simply give it a tag-name and your custom element will be defined.

```javascript
@customElement("hello-component")
export class HelloComponent extends LitElement {
	...
}
```
